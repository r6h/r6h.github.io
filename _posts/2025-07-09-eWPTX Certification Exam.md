# My eWPTX Certification Journey: Navigating Vulnerability Chains, Key Lessons, and Tips

## Introduction
I recently passed the eWPTX (eLearnSecurity Web Penetration Tester eXtreme) certification with an outstanding score, and I’d like to share my experience, along with my opinion on the test and a general explanation of how I managed it. This writeup narrates my journey through the certification process, detailing the vulnerabilities I identified and the exploit chains I crafted, all _while adhering to INE’s strict disclosure policies_. 
>**Disclaimer**: This writeup discusses general penetration testing skills and methodologies learned during certification preparation, without disclosing any exam-specific content such as questions, answers, or lab details.

## 1. Context and Preparation Tips
Let’s start by talking about the test itself. Once it begins, it lasts for **18 uninterrupted hours**, so it’s crucial to manage your time well and take breaks when necessary; for eating, exercising, or simply resting by doing another activity if you feel stuck at any point. That would be the ideal approach, of course, but in my case, I started the test, read the requirements, and went to the gym before beginning. Yes, with the countdown already running. This cost me a few hours at the start, but it later helped me stay hyper-focused for 7 consecutive hours, with one break for a midnight walk and a meal to regain focus. I began working on the lab at 5 PM and finished the attempt at 3 AM, taking about 10 hours to complete the test, including breaks and additional time to explore the lab environment (with better time management, I could have finished hours earlier—take my example as a guide on what **NOT** to do during an audit of this level).

## 2. The Starting Point: Reconnaissance and Mapping the Network
My journey began with reconnaissance, as in almost every penetration test. I needed to understand the network’s landscape before diving into exploitation.

- **Procedure**:
  - Used network scanning tools to identify open ports and services across multiple hosts.
  - Captured HTTP requests with Burp Suite to enumerate endpoints, headers, and authentication mechanisms.
  - Analyzed responses for version information and misconfigurations.

- **Thought Process**:
  - Assumed diverse services meant multiple attack vectors; prioritized thorough enumeration to avoid missing entry points. Initially, I focused on a single host, missing the broader network context; I then pivoted to comprehensive scanning. I lost significant time here but managed to add the following findings to my list, based on OWASP's Top 10:
- **Findings**:
  - Discovered web applications, APIs, possible information about a database, a [REDACTED]-based service, and a storage interface.
  - Noted potential for **A01: Broken Access Control**, **A02: Cryptographic Failures**, and **A03: Injection**.


This enabled me to build a detailed service map, setting the stage for targeted attacks while keeping my scope structured and organized.


## 3. First Exploit Chain: Information Disclosure Leading to Password Cracking and Privilege Escalation
Early in my exploration, I stumbled upon a vulnerability that opened the door to a powerful exploit chain.

- **Vulnerability**: **A01: Broken Access Control** and **A05: Security Misconfiguration**
  - An API endpoint responded to non-standard HTTP methods, leaking sensitive data.
- **Procedure**:
  - Tested various HTTP methods after noticing permissive server responses.
  - Captured a response containing usernames, emails, algorithm-hashed passwords, and additional user-related data.
  - Saved hashes to a file and used a cracking tool with a wordlist and custom patterns based on information gathered through this.
- **Exploit Chain**:
  - Leaked data provided admin credentials (hash cracked to reveal a weak password).
  - Used credentials to authenticate to a protected API, gaining an OAuth2 token for admin access.
- **Thought Process**:
  - Hypothesized that non-standard methods might bypass access controls, a common misconfiguration in staging environments, therefore, I expected weak passwords due to relaxed security in testing setups.

## 4. Second Exploit Chain: JWT Authentication Bypass Chained with NoSQL Injection
Next, I tackled a service using JSON Web Tokens for authentication, suspecting cryptographic weaknesses, as I always play with JWTs that get intercepted between requests.

- **Vulnerability**: **A02: Cryptographic Failures** and **A03: Injection**
  - Found a service with weak JWT signature validation, allowing crafted tokens to bypass authentication.
  - The same service had a [REDACTED] option vulnerable to NoSQL injection.
- **Exploit Chain**:
  - Sadly I can't give many details about how this exploit chain worked due to the privacy policy, but at least I can say that it was *really fun* to exploit. I leveraged a lesser-known CVE to leverage the initial vulnerability and escalate it to a **A03: Injection** type of exploit.
- **Thought Process**:
  - Error messages suggested specific payload requirements; iterated systematically based on my criteria until I got a payload working.
  - Recognized NoSQL injection potential after inspecting how the service runnnig behind that JWT was operating.
- **Wrong Path**:
  - Initially, I didn’t know which payload to use and couldn’t find a logical test. After overthinking, I pivoted to analyze the behavior of the service based on manual error-based testing. This finally led to an auth bypass with injection to achieve full data leakage.

## 5. Third Exploit Chain: SQL Injection for Data Extraction
One of the most challenging discoveries was a web application vulnerable to SQL injection, requiring a refined approach.

- **Vulnerability**: **A03: Injection**
  - A parameter in a web endpoint processed user input directly into a relational database query, enabling [REDACTED]-type of SQL injection.
- **Procedure**:
  - Tested parameters with single quotes and boolean conditions. I observed the output to understand server behavior. I tried various methods until I identified the injection type.
  - Crafted type-specific payloads to then pass them into sqlmap to assist me with data extraction to confirm my PoC.
- **Thought Process**:
  - Suspected blind injection due to lack of error messages; timing attacks confirmed the hypothesis.
  - Leveraged prior credentials to target admin-related tables, maximizing impact.

## 6. Fourth Exploit Chain: Insecure Deserialization in a [REDACTED] Service
A [REDACTED] service caught my attention during enumeration, hinting at a deserialization vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability**: **A08: Insecure Deserialization**
  - A service exposed a remote method invocation interface with libraries known for deserialization flaws.
- **Procedure**:
  - Identified vulnerable libraries during reconnaissance (e.g., similar to [REDACTED] issues).
  - Crafted a base64-encoded serialized object and sent it via Burp Suite.
  - Analyzed server errors to confirm deserialization occurred.
- **Exploit Chain**:
  - Triggered deserialization with a test object, causing server errors that indicated vulnerability.
  - Iterated payloads to achieve potential code execution, potentially chaining with prior admin access for deeper impact.
- **Thought Process**:
  - Recognized [REDACTED] as a deserialization vector due to its handling of serialized objects. Expected errors to reveal deserialization; used Burp to refine payloads. Confirmed deserialization vulnerability, opening the door to RCE.
- **Wrong Path**:
  - Initial HTTP requests to the service failed due to protocol mismatch, I didn't fully understand why at the beginning, but once I found out what was the issue, I set the same protocol used by the service and got it working.

## 7. Fifth Exploit Chain: Environment Configuration Leak for Full Control
This was actually the first exploit chain I found but left incomplete until the end of the test.

- **Vulnerability**: **A05: Security Misconfiguration**
  - A storage-related service exposed environment variables through a misconfigured endpoint.
- **Procedure**:
  - Sent requests to various endpoints, discovering one that returned internal configuration data.
  - Extracted variables, including administrative credentials.
- **Exploit Chain**:
  - Used leaked credentials to access a management interface, creating or enumerating admin users.
  - Combined with prior chains to retrieve data for full system compromise.
- **Thought Process**:
  - Hypothesized that storage services often leak configs in staging environments. Tested non-standard endpoints after standard API calls failed. After gaining initial access, I tried to escalate privileges using data from other exploit chains.
- **Wrong Path**:
  - Initially targeted incorrect endpoints, expecting standard API responses. I pivoted to UI-based access after realizing I was overcomplicating things.

## Lessons Learned
The certification was a bunch of dead ends and breakthroughs. Wrong paths, like incorrect JWT fields or failed bypass techniques, taught me to lean on error messages and pivot quickly. Key takeaways:
- **Persistence**: Even when things don't really work the first time, or the second, or the third, or the 27th... you can't give up; if you're feeling exhausted on the same vulnerability, just move on to different things and come back later refreshed.
- **Chaining**: Combining vulnerabilities (e.g., disclosure to cracking, auth bypass to injection) maximized impact.
- **Methodology**: You must have a well-defined testing methodology to avoid **falling into rabbit holes**, which can make you lose hours without gaining anything and drain your mental energy.
- **Ethical Mindset**: Controlled testing ensured no harm to the simulated environment, making sure the PoCs would not break the application if it was a real environment.

## Conclusion
The eWPTX journey tested my technical and mental resilience, turning challenges into opportunities. Each exploit chain built on the last, creating a narrative of discovery that was pretty fun once I was getting to the end of it, but frustrating at the start. In my opinion, this is a great certification for those who want to pursue a career in web-focused security or bug bounty, but even if not, it's a great entry point if you want to get into a deeper cybersecurity field as you will learn a great deal from the experience and it can definitely open some doors for you.
